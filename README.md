# Laravel TUI (Terminal User Interface)

A modern, Laravel-native TUI framework for building interactive terminal apps with expressive, Eloquent-style APIs and robust, responsive layouts.

## Vision
- Declarative, fluent API for composing TUIs (like Blade for the terminal)
- Nested, constraint-based layouts (vertical, horizontal, sidebar, etc.)
- Framework-managed redraw/input loopâ€”users only declare UI and handle actions
- Responsive: Widgets always fit the terminal viewport, adapt to resize
- Extensible: Easy to create custom widgets and layouts
- Professional UX: Uses alternate screen buffer, raw mode, and robust rendering

## Features
- Alternate screen buffer for clean, non-scrolling TUIs
- Handles terminal resizing and input automatically
- Widgets: navbar, block, table, list, sidebar, paragraph, etc.
- Composable, deeply nestable layouts
- Designed for extensibility

## Status
**In early development.**
- Core layout engine and redraw loop in progress
- Widget and layout APIs subject to change

## Roadmap
See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for next steps and architectural notes.
